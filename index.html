<h2>How is Volleyball played?</h2>

<p>Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</p>
